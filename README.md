# ojdk-cdt

Note: these CDT projects link their needed sources from the ojdk repository. They are meant to be placed *outside* the jdk repository. Simplest way, just clone them into your workspace directory.

- clone
- Workspace wide Linked Resources:
  - set OPENJDK_SOURCE_ROOT to root of jdk repository
  - set OPENJDK_OUTPUT_ROOT to root of jdk build directory 
- import hs, hs-gtests projects into workspace
